# Linked Lists

### Quick Overview
* A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.

* Each element (we will call it a node) of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. 
* The last node has a reference to null. 

* The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list. It should be noted that head is not a separate node, but the reference to the first node. If the list is empty then the head is a null reference.

* A linked list is a dynamic data structure. The number of nodes in a list is not fixed and can grow and shrink on demand. Any application which has to deal with an unknown number of objects will need to use a linked list.
